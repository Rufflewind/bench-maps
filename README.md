# Benchmark of map implementations

Some quick and dirty benchmarks of various map (associative array)
implementations in Rust and C++.

Included are:

  - Rust's `BTreeMap` implemented using B-trees.
  - Rust's `HashMap` implemented using hash tables.
  - C++'s `ordered_map` implemented using red-black trees.
  - C++'s `unordered_map` implemented using hash tables.
